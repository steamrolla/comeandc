##solutions to the exercises in the infamous "The C Programming Language"

I have very little experience with C. I've only played with it, and, it's been around 5 years.

I'm doing this to:
  1. Learn C the simple way (obviously starting with the king of the hill: KnR).
  2. Keep an up-to-date, collaborative repo for anybody wishing to do the same.
  3. Provide simple bash scripts to easily navigate & explore the samples.
